. Profit View Insights:

Monthly Profit Trends:


January to August shows fluctuating profits. February saw the highest total profits, with "Profit 1" peaking at 1.14M and "Profit 2" at 994K.

June also had significant profit, with "Profit 1" reaching 1.35M and "Profit 2" at 660K.

August saw a decline compared to earlier months, with "Profit 1" being 628K.

Discount Band Wise Profit:

The Low discount band generated the highest profit across all categories, with 4.47M for "Profit 1" and 2.39M for "Profit 2."

The Medium discount band also performed well, particularly in "Profit 1" at 3.46M and "Profit 2" at 2.79M.

High discount band generated the least profits across all categories, likely indicating that the highest discounts resulted in reduced profitability.

Segment Wise Profit:


32.68% of the total profit came from Segment 2 (likely "Channel Partners").

20.76% came from Segment 1 (could be "Government").

Other segments like Midmarket (8.41%) and Enterprise (3.57%) contributed smaller portions of the overall profit.

Country-wise Profit Performance:


The map shows profits distributed across several regions. The U.S. and Canada appear to contribute significantly (denoted by larger bubbles), while smaller bubbles over Europe and other regions indicate less contribution.

2. Gross Sales View Insights:

3. 
Monthly Sales Performance:


Sales fluctuate between 6M to 13M throughout the year. Peaks in July, September, and November at 13M.

The summer months (June, July, and August) maintain steady sales around the 9M range, with spikes in specific months like September and November.

Country-wise Gross Sales:


United States had the highest sales, reaching 87M, followed by Canada at 86M and France at 82M.

Germany and Mexico had lower sales, both hovering around 70M-73M.

Segment-wise Gross Sales:


Channel Partners contributed the most to sales, with 99M.

Government followed at 42M, and Small Business at 37M.

Enterprise and Midmarket segments had much lower contributions, around 2M each.

Discount Band Wise Gross Sales:

All three discount bands (Low, Medium, High) contributed similarly to sales, at around 0.03bn.

3. COGS (Cost of Goods Sold) View Insights:

Monthly COGS Trends:


January to June shows fairly stable COGS, mostly around 5M to 8M.

May and June show a slight increase to 8M, signaling higher costs during those months.

Discount Band Wise COGS:

All discount bands have a COGS rate of 25%, showing consistent cost-to-sales ratios across different discount levels.

Country-wise COGS:

United States and Canada have the highest COGS, both around 17M.

Germany, Mexico, and France follow closely with 14M to 16M.

Segment-wise COGS:


Segment 1 (likely Channel Partners) has the largest share of COGS at 30.92M (38.99%), followed by Segment 2 at 15.98M (20.16%).

General Observations:

Channel Partners (Segment 2) play a critical role in both sales and profit, contributing the largest portions.

Discount Band Analysis shows that the Low discount band generated the most profits and sales, while the High discount band resulted in lower profitability, likely due to high discounts eating into profit margins.

The U.S. and Canada are the largest contributors both in terms of sales and COGS, implying a major focus in North America.

Monthly Trends show that February had the highest profit, while September and November were strong months for gross sales.

These insights provide a clear understanding of the company's performance by highlighting key profit, sales, and cost drivers across various segments, regions, and discount bands.
